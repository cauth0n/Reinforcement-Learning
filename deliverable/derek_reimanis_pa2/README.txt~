Greetings!!

Welcome to my Reinforcement Learning experience!

The program is only functioning with Value Iteration at this point in time. 
Q Learning is implemented, but needs some debugging.

The ./data/ folder consists of walkthroughs, and an archive of all tracks practiced on.

In the walkthrough folder, you can get the first-hand experience of the speedy racer
as he/she dodges obstacles while racing to the finish line!

In the src folder, you can analyze the complex, in-depth code that brings 
the algorithm to fruition.

To run the program yourself, type this into the command line directly:

java -jar -Xms1024M -Xmx4096M super_slick_racer.jar

Enjoy!!
